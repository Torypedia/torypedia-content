## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
